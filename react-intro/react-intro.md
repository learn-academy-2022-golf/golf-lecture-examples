# React

- React is a Javascript Library for building user interfaces
  - UI(user interface) is how the user interacts with an app

- Library - collection of code snippets for devs to use
- Javascript library is code snippets are node modules

## Why is React popular
- Component based - built from little pieces
- Reusable
- Scalable
- User interactions focused

### Scalability
- Think about how can app grow
- Create code that will work under many conditions

### Reusabilty
- Components
  - functions that are reusable
  - return data including objects
    - Objects have data and behavior
    - Can hold JSX (Javascript XML)
      - JSX is JS flavored markdown that behaves like HTML

### User Interactions
- DOM (Document Object Model) - visual representation of your code
- Node - represents a single HTML element
- Virtual DOM - Listen s to the individual nodes in the DOM and compares the change and refreshes ONLY the affected elements

### React Components
- Made up of functions
- Needs a return
- JSX is inside the return
- Component Call/ Invocation: <ComponentCall />

  - yarn start
- React is an SPA(single page application)
- Generally one component per file
- React components bring info from other files using import
